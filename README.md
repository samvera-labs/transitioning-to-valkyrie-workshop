# [Transitioning to Valkyrie](https://samveraconnect2023.sched.com/event/1OmBn)

This repository supports a workshop given at
[Samvera Connect 2023](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/2174877699/Samvera+Connect+2023).

Valkyrie is a data persistence library which provides a common interface to multiple backends. There are a growing number of Samvera applications that use Valkyrie including Hyrax. This workshop will introduce core concepts and how they differ from ActiveFedora, ActiveRecord, and ActiveStorage. Weâ€™ll build a simple rails application that uses Valkyrie to write metadata to a postgres database and store files on disk.

This workshop assumes a general familiarity with Object Orientation and Ruby programming. Participants will need a laptop with a working docker/docker compose setup. We'll provide preparation instructions to registered attendees in advance of the workshop.

## Learning Outcomes

We will learn:
- Familiarity with general design patterns for Valkyrie and Dry.rb applications.
- Familiarity with patterns applied in Hyrax 4 and common integration points for applications
- Ideas about how to apply Hyrax patterns to improve maintainability of Hyrax 3.x and 4.x applications
